# Nice to meet you!
I'm **Eddie**, a Junior CS major at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.

:seedling: I first discovered my passion for computer science back in 7th grade through Javascript courses on Khan Academy. In the years since, I've learned much more about web development and have become very familiar with languages such as **Javascript**, **Typescript**, **CSS**, and more, as well as other tools like **React** , **Node.js**, and **MongoDB**. My path has helped build my drive to develop free, open-source applications and tools that are easy to use, whether their purpose be educational, time-saving, or something else entirely!


:books: I'm currently learning:
- Go
- Operational Transformation algorithms

:chess_pawn: Besides software development, I love to play all kinds of board games and play soccer. I haven't played soccer officially since highschool, but being a goalkeeper for my entire childhood helped me develop my leadership and communication skills immensely.

 :diamond_shape_with_a_dot_inside: [Argument Diagrams](https://argument-diagram.bram-hub.com/), a web-based educational tool for diagramming argumentative formal logic. Along with a small team, we created this tool for a non-technical professor over the summer of 2021, and now it is being used as an educational resource in class!

 **Existential Graphs**, an in-progress web-based educational tool for modelling and diagramming existential formal logic.

:desktop_computer: **Computer Graphics Final Project** This project is a simple scene of some generated terrain decorated with various textures, water, trees, lighting, etc. It was created in C++ using OpenGL. To read more about the techniques used, see the [repo](https://github.com/eddiekrystowski/GraphicsFinal).
